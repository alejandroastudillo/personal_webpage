This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Deploy with gh-pages

# Deploying a React App* to GitHub Pages

\* created using `create-react-app`

# Introduction

In this tutorial, I'll show you how I deployed a React app—which I created using `create-react-app`—to GitHub Pages.

You can visit the deployed app, at [https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages/](https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages/).

This repository contains the files related to the app. The `master` branch contains the app's source code (the code the app's developers edit), and the `gh-pages` branch contains a *built* version of the app (i.e. the code that GitHub Pages serves to the app's visitors).

The remainder of this document contains a tutorial on creating a React app (using `create-react-app`) and deploying that app to GitHub Pages.

# Tutorial

## Prerequisites

1. An adequate version of [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. Here's the adequate version I use:

    ```sh
    $ node --version
    v6.10.1
    ```

2. An adequate version of  [`npm`](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. Here's the adequate version I use:

    ```sh
    $ npm --version
    3.10.10
    ```
3. An adequate version of [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is installed. Here's the adequate version I use:

    ```sh
    $ create-react-app --version
    1.3.1
    ```

    In the case of `create-react-app`, you can either install it globally (i.e. `$ npm install -g create-react-app`) or install it locally (i.e. `$ npm install create-react-app`). If you choose the latter, you will have to specify its path whenever you invoke it (e.g. `path/to/node_modules/.bin/create-react-app`).

4. (**Optional**) An adequate version of [`sed`](http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) is installed. Here's the adequate version I use:

   ```sh
   $ sed --version
   sed (GNU sed) 4.4
   ```

5. A [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. :octocat:

6. A command-line Git client [setup according to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Procedure

1. **Create an *empty* repository on GitHub.** (2 minutes)

    * For this tutorial, I'll create a repository named `react-gh-pages`.
    * By *empty*, I mean *without* a `README.md` file, a `.gitignore` file, a `LICENSE` file, or any other files.

2. **Create a new React app on your computer.** (5 minutes)

    ```sh
    $ npx create-react-app react-gh-pages
    ```
    
    * This is the app you will deploy to GitHub Pages in step 7.
    * I opted to give the app the same name as my GitHub repository (i.e. `react-gh-pages`). However, you can name them differently from one another (e.g. you can name your app `app-123` and your GitHub Repository `repo-456`).
    * This will create a new folder named `react-gh-pages` (or whatever you named your app) on your computer.

3. **Install the `gh-pages` package as a "dev-dependency" of the app.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ cd react-gh-pages
    $ yarn add gh-pages
    ```
    
    * The commands shown in the following steps can all be issued from within the app's folder.

4. **Add some properties to the app's `package.json` file.** (3 minutes)

    * At the top level, add a `homepage` property. Define its value to be the string `http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`, where `{username}` is your GitHub username, and `{repo-name}` is the name of the GitHub repository you created in step 1. Since my GitHub username is `gitname` and the name of my GitHub repository is `react-gh-pages`, I added the following property:
    
    ```js
    //...
    "homepage": "http://alejandroastudillo.github.io/"
    ```
    
    * In the existing `scripts` property, add a `predeploy` property and a `deploy` property, each having the values shown below:

    ```js
    "scripts": {
      //...
      "predeploy": "yarn run build",
      "deploy": "gh-pages -b master -d build"
    }
    ```
    
    * **Shortcut:** Instead of adding those properties using a text editor; if I have `sed` installed on my system, I can add the properties by issuing the following shell commands:
    
    ```sh
    $ sed -i '5i\  "homepage": "http://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages",' ./package.json
    $ sed -i '15i\    "predeploy": "npm run build",' ./package.json
    $ sed -i '16i\    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",' ./package.json
    ```
    
5. **Create a git repository in the app's folder.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in C:/path/to/react-gh-pages/.git/
    ```

6. **Add the GitHub repository as a "remote" in your local git repository.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages.git
    ```
    
    * This will make it so the `gh-pages` package knows where you want it to deploy your app in step 7.
    * It will also make it so git knows where you want it to push your source code (i.e. the commits on your `master` branch) in step 8.

7. **Generate a *production build* of your app, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.** (2 minutes)

    ```
    $ yarn deploy
    ```
    
    * That's it! Your app is now accessible at the URL you specified in step 4.
    * In my case, my app is now accessible at: https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages/
    * I recommend exploring the GitHub repository at this point. When I explored it, I noticed that, although a `master` branch did not exist, a `gh-pages` branch did exist. I noticed the latter contained the *built* app code, as opposed to the app's source code.

8. **Optionally, commit your source code to the "master" branch and push your commit to GitHub.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Create a React app and publish it to GitHub Pages"
    $ git push origin master
    ```

    * I recommend exploring the GitHub repository once again at this point. When I did that, I noticed that a `master` branch now existed, and it contained the app's source code.
    * So, the `master` branch held the source code, and the `gh-pages` branch held the *built* app code.
...

Next, let's create a new branch...since master will contain our build files pretty soon and minifiy, bundle and get weird, we need a new branch that will serve as our source code - so we can make changes and we don't lose our beautiful human-able readable code.

While in the master branch, let's create our source branch... you can name it whatever you want.
```
$ git checkout -b source
$ git push origin source
```
Yay! Our source branch is a direct copy of our master. Now, on Github we need to update our Default branch, master, to our source branch...and that's also why we pushed it (so Github knows it exists).

Navigate to your repo on Github, and select "Settings".
On the left-side panel, click on "Branches".
Next, you're able to select your source branch and update it under the Default branch heading.
